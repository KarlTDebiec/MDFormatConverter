The purpose of this script is to loop over segments of an AMBER, ANTON,
DESMOND, or GROMACS trajectory, select a subset of atoms, and save their
coordinates to GROMACS' .xtc format. Additionally, the first frame of each
segment is saved to a .pdb file. The program depends on vmd and GROMACS'
trjconv tool. The intended use is to remove waters to speed up later analysis.
