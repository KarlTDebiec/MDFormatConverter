xtc_converter README

The purpose of this script is to automate conversion of AMBER, ANTON, DESMOND,
and GROMACS trajectories into an efficient and consistent format. It loads
each segment of a trajectory using VMD, selects a subset of atoms, saves their
topology to .pdb format, and saves their coordinates to GROMACS' .xtc format.
The intended usage is to remove waters from trajectories to speed up analysis,
and to use one set of analysis tools for multiple packages. VMD and GROMACS'
trjconv are required.
